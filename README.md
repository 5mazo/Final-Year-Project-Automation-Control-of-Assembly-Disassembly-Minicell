# MAP-205 Automation & Control System  
> Automated Assembly-Disassembly Training System with PLC & HMI (Educational Lab Project)  

## 📖 Project Overview  
This project focuses on the **automation and control of the SMC MAP-205 training kit**, an advanced industrial automation minicell used at **Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM)**.  
The MAP-205 replicates a **real industrial assembly cell**, making it a powerful tool for teaching and hands-on training in industrial automation.  

The primary goal of this project was to:  
1. **Automate the assembly and disassembly process** using PLC ladder logic.  
2. **Develop a Human-Machine Interface (HMI)** in CX-Designer for real-time monitoring and control.  
3. **Prepare a structured lab sheet** that allows students to learn and practice automation workflows step by step.  

This project not only demonstrates technical achievement in automation but also creates **long-term educational value** by helping students gain practical experience before entering industry.

## 🔧 About the SMC MAP-205  
The **SMC MAP-205** is a **modular automation training system** produced by **SMC Corporation**, a global leader in pneumatic and industrial automation solutions.  

It is widely used in universities and training centers because it:  
- Provides **real-world industrial components** (sensors, actuators, feeders, conveyors).  
- Simulates **assembly and disassembly processes** similar to modern factory cells.  
- Allows practice in **PLC programming, sequencing (Grafcet), and HMI development**.  

Automating the MAP-205 is considered challenging because it requires:  
- Mastery of **PLC programming and logic sequencing**.  
- Designing a user-friendly **HMI interface**.  
- Synchronizing multiple actuators, sensors, and process steps without errors.
