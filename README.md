# 🤖 Automation Control of Assembly-Disassembly Minicell (MAP-205)

This project is a Final Year Project (FYP) focused on developing and optimizing an automated training system using the **MAP-205 minicell**. It is designed to enhance hands-on learning and industrial training in assembly and disassembly processes by integrating PLCs, sensors, actuators, and HMI/SCADA systems.

## 🧠 Project Objective

- ✅ Develop an automated system for assembly and disassembly training using the MAP-205.
- 📈 Integrate advanced monitoring and control features aligned with Industry 4.0.
- ⚙️ Evaluate system performance and optimize scan time and logic efficiency.

## 🏗️ System Overview

MAP-205 is an advanced mechatronic training kit that simulates real-world industrial assembly tasks. The system includes:

- PLC (Omron CP1H)
- Sensors (position, presence, and pressure)
- Actuators (pneumatic cylinders, rotary actuators, vacuum systems)
- HMI interface (CX-Designer)
- SCADA elements for advanced control and monitoring

## 🔁 System Operations

### Assembly Phases:

1. **Feeding the Base**: The base is positioned using a feeder and verified by sensors.
2. **Assembling the Bearing**: A gripper picks and places the bearing onto the base.
3. **Inserting the Shaft**: Shaft is inserted into the assembly using an actuator.
4. **Placing the Cap**: A lid is placed to complete the assembly.
5. **System Reset**: The process can be reversed for disassembly training.

### Operation Modes:

- 🔄 **Auto Mode**: Full automated sequence on button press.
- 🛠️ **Manual Mode**: Step-by-step control for teaching purposes.

## 🧪 Optimization Achievements

- 🔧 37% reduction in ladder rungs (247 → 156)
- ⚡ 36% faster scan time (4.2ms → 2.7ms)
- 🚀 69% improvement in system throughput
- 🧠 Smarter logic with MOVE/KEEP blocks and grouped I/O

## 📊 HMI & SCADA Integration

- User authentication
- Alarm management
- Real-time process visualization
